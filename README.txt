 What is ClassicMenu Indicator?
================================

ClassicMenu Indicator is a notification area applet (application
indicator) for the top panel of Ubuntu's `Unity desktop environment
<http://unity.ubuntu.com/>`_. It provides a simple way to get a
classic GNOME-style application menu for those who prefer this over
the Unity dash menu. Like the classic GNOME menu, it includes Wine
games and applications if you have those installed.
